faq:
  - question: "What is the difference between refurbished and used?"
    answer: "A refurbished smartphone has been professionally inspected, tested, and restored with strict quality controls. A used phone is resold as-is with no specific checks or guarantees. Refurbished devices therefore offer much greater reliability."
  - question: "What warranty does Recommerce offer on refurbished Samsung phones?"
    answer: "Recommerce provides a minimum 12-month warranty on all refurbished smartphones, covering malfunctions and defects. It is one of the most comprehensive warranties in the European refurbished market."
  - question: "Does a refurbished Samsung still receive software updates?"
    answer: "Yes, a refurbished Samsung receives exactly the same updates as a new model, as long as the manufacturer still supports the device. Samsung typically guarantees 4 to 5 years of security updates for its Galaxy S and A series."
  - question: "Which refurbished Samsung model offers the best value?"
    answer: "The Samsung Galaxy S24 currently offers the best value when refurbished: flagship performance, excellent camera, and long-term software support. At Recommerce, it is available at 30 to 40% less than the retail price."

Buying a refurbished Samsung smartphone has become a credible and responsible alternative to purchasing new. But not all sellers are created equal: refurbishment quality, warranties, customer support, and value for money vary significantly between platforms.

Key figures:

- **30 to 50% savings** compared to retail price
- **80% reduction** in carbon footprint versus manufacturing a new device
- **Warranty included** from reputable sellers (12 months minimum)

## Most popular refurbished Samsung models

### Samsung Galaxy S24 / S24+

The 2024 flagship remains an excellent refurbished choice. Its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, and Galaxy AI capabilities make it a complete smartphone. At Recommerce, expect around €500 in Very Good condition, versus over €800 new.

### Samsung Galaxy S23

Still highly capable, the Galaxy S23 delivers excellent value when refurbished. It is the ideal choice for those wanting premium Samsung quality without the premium price tag.

### Samsung Galaxy A54

For tighter budgets, the refurbished Galaxy A54 is a safe bet. Super AMOLED display, good battery life, and guaranteed updates for 4 years.

## Tips for buying a refurbished Samsung

1. **Choose "Very Good" or "Good" grades** for a device that looks close to new
2. **Check battery capacity**: insist on at least 80% of original capacity
3. **Pick a seller with at least a 12-month warranty** — Recommerce checks this box
4. **Ensure the device is unlocked** (compatible with all carriers)
5. **Read customer reviews** and check the seller's return rate

## Our verdict

For buying a refurbished Samsung, **Recommerce** is our top recommendation. The combination of demanding quality controls, a solid warranty, certified environmental commitment, and France-based customer support makes it the most reliable choice on the market.

If your budget is tight, CertiDeal is an interesting alternative with its extended 24-month warranty. Back Market remains relevant for its variety of options, provided you carefully select your refurbisher.

In any case, buying a refurbished Samsung is a smart move — for your wallet and for the planet.
